These simulations ran at dEta = 1e-3 taking 31 hours to complete. I left these figures open for anybody curious to continue inspecting the Venus-Mercury pair, since it is the only figure that did not converge relative to its dEta=1e-2 case. Instead, over time it appears to librate more often while still circulating. I tried to run this simulation again only including the inner terrestrial planets, but the Resonant arguments appeared very different. One will need a lot of patience to run smaller dEta values, since it seems that one has to include all of the planets to observe this interesting case.
